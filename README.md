## Description
This project contains code for a general purpose Partially Observable Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm taken from [1]. This is an online POMDP solver, *ie* it approximates the optimal policy locally at the current belief. 

## Documentation

<div style= "font-size: 140% ;color: rgb(39, 147, 221)"> auxilliary.py </div>

Contains some helpful functions and a class to help construct and manipulate the tree of agent beliefs.

The way we implemented the tree is through the BuildTree() class. Each node in the tree is associated with a list of five elements. These are:
1. The key of its parent node
2. A dictionary whose keys are either action or observation indices and its values are the key of some child node. This holds all the child nodes at each node. For example, say taking the index 1 action from the current node leads us to the key 253 node. Then there will be an entry {1:253} in this dictionary.
3. The number of times a simulation visited this node.
4. The current estimate of the nodes value (kept as a running average of simulation values)
5. The list of particles associated with the node; A list of all states that were sampled at this node at some simulation.

The association is implemented with a Python dictionary. Each node has a unique key which can be used to access its values. The root node always has -1 as key.
